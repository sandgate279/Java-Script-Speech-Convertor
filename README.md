# Java-Script-Speech-Convertor
Converts speech into text within a To do list.

Title of the Project: To Do List mobile app. 

Purpose of this app:

Introduction:
In our busy everyday life most of us try to remember tasks that we must do for 
the day. We do not 
prioritize them or even do not allocate them together in a 
time saving manner or in many cases we forget them as time passes by. This app 
helps to overcome this simple difficulty and make our lives easier.   
How this app can be utilized in real world 
scenario:
My to do list tasks are added in the app by 3 ways.
1.Voice command
Instead user typing in manually or selecting from the list,voice recognition is been programmed so that the user can just speak the tasks that can be added manually either by pressing "Enter " keyboard button or by clicking the "ADD"button in the app.   
2.Drop down box:
This app allows the user/customer to choose the list of tasks 
either from a drop down box. For Example:   Necessary predefined tasks in the drop down box th
at the user may just click and choose are like,  Purchase flight tickets-if you are a frequent traveller or make phone calls to update your daily work status to your boss or take insulin if you are diabetic etc.It might look like a simple thing to do butin long run we could save 100’s of hours. Once a task is completed it can be deleted as it is done.   
3.Manually type in:The user may or may not click the "ADD" button in the app to
insert the tasks into the list."ENTER" key stroke in the keypad can be pressed to do the same function,as it is programmed to do the same.  As an extra feature a geo location map is added to pin point the exact current location and a compass with a direction aid to show where the user is currently located.This facility is dynamic,that is if the app is excuted by an android device 
then the location is determined by Global facility Service(GPS) and if the same app 
is executed in a laptop or PC then the location is available through the IP address 
of the device used.And also a timer is added that shows the current time and the 
date.    
Relevance to the course material:
Concepts such as graphical user interface, sensors such as Compass/Geo location 
and microphone is used to make this application,along with programming 
language (Java script). Also, this app demonstrates the use of mobile app using 
either Android or IOS devices. (android for this application).   Cloud Integrated development environment (IDE) such as Monaca is used to build and deploy this app.   HTML-5 (Hypertext mark
up language) and Cascading Style Sheets are used in addition to JavaScript to make this application.   
Instructions on how to create this project:
Using Monaca IDE, the code written using HTML, CSS and java script can be converted into an APK(Android Package kid) file ,using “RUN ON DEVICE “menu option ,which can then be copied  into the file sharing facility of the android mobile device. This APK can then be installed in the mobile device. Connect your android device with the computer through USB cable. Enable developer options and USB debugging mode by tapping 7 times on the android device. 
Then the APK file can be installed as an app in the android mobile device.
